    "Cognimatch: Rules and How to Play",
    "Memory, also known as Concentration, is a classic card-matching game that tests your memory skills and attention to detail. Here's how to play this engaging game:"
  ],
  [
    "1. Setup:",
    "Begin by laying out all the cards face-down on a flat surface, arranging them in a grid formation. The number of cards can vary, but they are usually placed in rows and columns for easy visibility."
  ],
  [
    "2. Objective:",
    "The main goal of Memory is to find pairs of matching cards. Each card has a corresponding identical card in the deck. The challenge lies in remembering the position of each card and using that information to make successful matches."
  ],
  [
    "3. Taking Turns:",
    "In CogniMatch, the player who proposed the game takes the first turn. Players alternate turns throughout the game, with the initiator going first and the challenger taking the next turn, and so on."
  ],
  [
    "4. Making Matches:",
    "On their turn, a player selects two cards from the grid and flips them face-up. If the two cards matched, it's a match! The player keeps the matched pair and takes another turn. If the cards do not match, cards will get flip down."
  ],
  [
    "5. Memory Strategy:",
    "As the game progresses, players should remember the positions of the cards that have been revealed. This memory-building aspect adds an exciting challenge to the game."
  ],
  [
    "6. Non-Matching Cards:",
    "When a player flips two cards that don't match, it's important to turn them back face-down in the exact same positions. This way, all players have an equal chance to remember the cards' locations for future turns."
  ],
  [
    "7. Winning the Game:",
    "The game continues until all pairs of cards have been successfully matched. The player with the most pairs of cards at the end of the game is declared the winner. This victory requires a combination of memory, concentration, and a touch of luck."
